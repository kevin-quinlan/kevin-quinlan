- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm @kevin-quinlan

- Iâ€™m interested in contributing to the open source community and educating peers as I go.
- I like most all topics of computing and really enjoy mathematics.
- I do iOT projects for fun with microcontrollers such as the esp32, arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi (model 3B). Hoping to try out the Pi Compute modules sometime this summer.
